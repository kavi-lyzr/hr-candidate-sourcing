# âœ… Frontend Integration Complete!

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **SSE Hook** (`src/hooks/use-sse.ts`)
A custom React hook for managing Server-Sent Events connections:
- âœ… Auto-connects when sessionId is provided
- âœ… Accumulates streaming message chunks
- âœ… Detects `[DONE]` signal to close connection
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling
- âœ… Automatic cleanup on unmount
- âœ… Detailed console logging for debugging

**Key Features:**
```typescript
const { messages, isConnected, isDone, error } = useSSE(sessionId);
```

### 2. **Candidate Details API** (`src/app/api/candidates/get-by-ids/route.ts`)
Endpoint to fetch full candidate details from MongoDB:
- âœ… Accepts array of LinkedIn public_ids
- âœ… Queries CandidateProfile collection
- âœ… Returns formatted candidate data with all necessary fields
- âœ… Handles missing data gracefully with defaults
- âœ… Proper error handling and logging

**Usage:**
```typescript
POST /api/candidates/get-by-ids
Body: { publicIds: ["public-id-1", "public-id-2"] }
```

### 3. **Next.js Config Updates** (`next.config.ts`)
Added LinkedIn domains to allow profile and company images:
- âœ… `media.licdn.com` - For profile photos and company logos
- âœ… `static.licdn.com` - For static LinkedIn assets

### 4. **Main Search Page** (`src/app/page.tsx`)
Complete integration with backend agents:

#### **New State Management:**
```typescript
const [currentSessionId, setCurrentSessionId] = useState<string | null>(null);
const { messages: sseMessages, isDone, error: sseError } = useSSE(currentSessionId);
```

#### **Real Search Implementation:**
- âœ… Calls `/api/chat/start-search` to initiate agent
- âœ… Receives session ID and connects to SSE stream
- âœ… Shows real-time streaming of agent responses
- âœ… Updates loading state based on stream progress

#### **SSE Message Processing:**
- âœ… Waits for stream completion (`isDone`)
- âœ… Parses markdown links `[Name](public_id)` from agent response
- âœ… Extracts candidate public IDs
- âœ… Fetches full candidate details from database
- âœ… Displays candidates in UI with all information

#### **Enhanced Loading States:**
```typescript
// Shows different messages based on stream state
{sseMessages.length === 0 
  ? 'Connecting to AI agent...' 
  : 'Searching LinkedIn...'}

// Displays streaming agent responses in real-time
{sseMessages.join('')}
```

#### **Error Handling:**
- âœ… Catches API errors with user-friendly messages
- âœ… Handles SSE connection failures
- âœ… Shows toast notifications for errors
- âœ… Graceful fallback messages

## How It Works - Complete Flow

### **User Journey:**

1. **User enters search query** â†’ "Find React developers in San Francisco"

2. **Frontend calls** `/api/chat/start-search`
   - Sends query and optional JD ID
   - Receives `sessionId`

3. **SSE connection opens** â†’ `/api/chat/stream/[sessionId]`
   - Real-time streaming begins
   - Messages accumulate in `sseMessages` array

4. **Backend agent starts working:**
   - Agent analyzes query
   - Calls `search_candidates` tool
   - Tool queries LinkedIn API (3-step process)
   - Profiles stored in MongoDB
   - Agent receives formatted profiles
   - Agent generates response with markdown links

5. **Frontend receives stream:**
   ```
   "I found 10 candidates matching your criteria:
   
   [John Doe](john-doe-123)
   [Jane Smith](jane-smith-456)
   ..."
   ```

6. **Stream completes** â†’ `[DONE]` signal received

7. **Frontend processes response:**
   - Extracts public IDs: `["john-doe-123", "jane-smith-456", ...]`
   - Calls `/api/candidates/get-by-ids`
   - Receives full candidate details
   - Renders candidates with photos, logos, etc.

8. **User sees results:**
   - AI response text
   - Top 3 recommendations (detailed cards)
   - All profiles list (compact view)
   - Save buttons for each candidate

## Testing the Integration

### **Before Testing:**

1. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   # .env.local
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
   NEXT_PUBLIC_LYZR_API_KEY=your_lyzr_key
   RAPID_API_BASE=linkedin-api.p.rapidapi.com
   RAPID_API_KEY=your_rapidapi_key
   ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_encryption_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. **Login first to create agents:**
   - Agents are created on first login
   - Tool with x-token header is created
   - Agent versions auto-update on login

### **Test Checklist:**

#### âœ… **Basic Flow:**
- [ ] Start dev server: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Login to create your agents
- [ ] Enter search query: "Software engineers in San Francisco"
- [ ] Verify SSE connection in Network tab (type: eventsource)
- [ ] Watch streaming response appear in real-time
- [ ] Verify candidate cards render with images

#### âœ… **Network Tab Checks:**
- [ ] POST to `/api/chat/start-search` (200 OK)
- [ ] SSE to `/api/chat/stream/[sessionId]` (EventSource)
- [ ] See streaming data chunks
- [ ] POST to `/api/candidates/get-by-ids` (200 OK)

#### âœ… **Console Logs:**
Look for these log patterns:
```
[Search] Starting search with query: ...
[Search] Received session ID: ...
[SSE] Connecting to session: ...
[SSE] Connection opened
[SSE] Received chunk: ...
[SSE] Stream completed
[SSE] Found candidate links: [...]
[SSE] Fetching candidate details...
[SSE] Fetched X candidate details
[SSE] Stream processing complete
```

#### âœ… **UI Behavior:**
- [ ] Loading state shows "Connecting to AI agent..."
- [ ] Changes to "Searching LinkedIn..." when stream starts
- [ ] Shows streaming agent response text
- [ ] Displays candidate cards when complete
- [ ] LinkedIn profile images load correctly
- [ ] Company logos display properly
- [ ] Reset button clears conversation

#### âœ… **Error Scenarios:**
- [ ] No LinkedIn API key â†’ Shows error message
- [ ] Invalid query â†’ Agent responds appropriately
- [ ] Network error â†’ Toast notification appears
- [ ] SSE connection lost â†’ Error handled gracefully

## What's NOT Implemented Yet

### ðŸ”² **Save Profile Functionality**
Currently the Save buttons are visible but not functional. To implement:
- Create `/api/profiles/save` endpoint
- Store in `SavedProfile` collection
- Link to `SearchSession`
- Show toast on successful save

### ðŸ”² **Follow-up Conversations**
Right now, each search creates a new session. To implement:
- Reuse existing sessionId for follow-ups
- Maintain conversation context
- Allow refinement of search

### ðŸ”² **Search History**
The History dropdown is empty. To implement:
- Store completed searches in localStorage
- Load past conversations
- Allow users to revisit old results

### ðŸ”² **Filters**
The "Edit Filters" button opens a dialog but doesn't affect search. To implement:
- Pass filter criteria to agent
- Agent uses filters in tool call
- UI shows active filters

## Environment Variables Summary

All required environment variables:

```bash
# Required for agents
NEXT_PUBLIC_LYZR_API_KEY=xxx

# Required for LinkedIn search
RAPID_API_BASE=linkedin-api.p.rapidapi.com
RAPID_API_KEY=xxx

# Required for database
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://...

# Required for tool authentication
ENCRYPTION_KEY=xxx  # Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32

# Required for tool callbacks
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000  # or your domain
```

---

## Architecture Clarification

**About API Keys:**
- Each user's agents are created in THEIR Lyzr account
- We store the user's Lyzr API key (encrypted) in our database
- This key is used to create/update their personal agents
- Tools are created with x-token header (encrypted user ID)
- This ensures each user's searches are isolated and secure

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### **Problem: No SSE connection**
**Check:**
- Is user logged in?
- Is sessionId valid?
- Network tab shows EventSource?
- Browser console for errors?

### **Problem: No candidates displayed**
**Check:**
- Did agent call the tool?
- Are profiles in MongoDB?
- Check `/api/candidates/get-by-ids` response
- Verify public_id parsing regex

### **Problem: Images not loading**
**Check:**
- next.config.ts has LinkedIn domains?
- Image URLs in candidate data?
- Network tab shows 200 for images?
- Try opening image URL directly

### **Problem: "Connection lost" error**
**Check:**
- Backend logs for agent errors
- LinkedIn API credentials valid?
- MongoDB connection working?
- SSE timeout (5 minutes)?
